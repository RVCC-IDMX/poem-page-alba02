    <h4>        I'm going to borrow a famous saying and assert: In web development, "Content is King."

        When we learn or practice web development, we often constantly need to have content, whether it be text, images, or data. We need these so that there is something that lives between the HTML tags and is available to be styled. 
        
        But we are not typically great content creators and copyright laws keep us from willy-nilly taking the work of others. This is why we resort to Lorem Ipsum so much. The problem with this approach is that lorem text is neither professional, nor is it terribly representative of real text. 
        
        One approach to the problem is to find real content that is not restricted, because either it is in the public domain or the copyright owner has published a lenient license for its use. (Search for MIT license, CC0 license, etc. to understand this better.)
        
        The time period for a work to be under copyright protection was extended by a US law enacted in 1998. Opponents of the law call it the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act" because the Disney corporation lobbied for the law to protect its work for a longer period of time.
        
        This law has kept some material 
        
        Unfortunately, works that are in the public domain because they were published before January 1, 1927 and are easily found to copy from the Internet, tend to heavily represent authors who are white, male and of European descent.
        If you are looking for content for this project and you cannot find something in the public domain that interests you, here are a few suggestions:

        Use some of you own work from a different time, or make up a haiku or two.
        Get a license for the work (is your Mom or Uncle a poet?)
        Find a poem you really like, pass it by me first, and, if it looks like it can be used under Educational Fair Use, I'll approve it. </h4>
