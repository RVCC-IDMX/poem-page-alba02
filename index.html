    <h3> By James Jeffrey Roche</h3>
    <h4>BABY’S brain is tired of thinking	
        On the Wherefore and the Whence;	
      Baby’s precious eyes are blinking	
        With incipient somnolence.	
       
      Little hands are weary turning	        5
        Heavy leaves of lexicon;	
      Little nose is fretted learning	
        How to keep its glasses on.	
       
      Baby knows the laws of nature	
        Are beneficent and wise;	        10
      His medulla oblongata	
        Bids my darling close his eyes,	
       
      And his pneumogastrics tell him	
        Quietude is always best	
      When his little cerebellum	        15
        Needs recuperative rest.	
       
      Baby must have relaxation,	
        Let the world go wrong or right.	
      Sleep, my darling, leave Creation	
        To its chances for the night.</h4>
